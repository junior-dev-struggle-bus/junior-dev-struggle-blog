It's a [Wayward Monday](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgrybccbkc/) once again. Even with the kinder weather, come warm up with some coffee and code. Maybe a bit of hot choccy? 

The next social event has been schedule at [Optimism Brewing](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/268145248/) once again. These are always a blast with a great turn out and a lot of laughs. [We'll see you there on February 21st!](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/268145248/)

On a final note, we're still nailing down the last scheduling details of the interview prep series. We should have that solidified by next week's update.
