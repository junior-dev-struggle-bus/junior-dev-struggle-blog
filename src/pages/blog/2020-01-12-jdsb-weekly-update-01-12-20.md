How has 2020 been treating everyone so far? We have a small update but a big week.

We have our usual [Wayward meet on Monday](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgrybccbrb/). If you're in the mood for a different sort of brew, join us for our first weekend event at [Optimism Brewing on Friday](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/267103066/). We look forward to seeing you all at one or, if you're particularly adventurous, both!

If starting and ending your week with us isn't enough, feel free to come chat, share memes, or help a fellow struggle busser with some code over on the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack).
