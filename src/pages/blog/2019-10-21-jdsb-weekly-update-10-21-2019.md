We broke 700 members and October is JDSB's birth month, so we are now about a year old! Thanks to everyone that has participated in the community and those who have come and gone along the way. It's been great watching the community grow. We hope to have some exciting announcements coming up that will make our second year even better.

For now, we look forward to seeing some of you tonight at the [Wayward](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryznbcc/). Come to mingle, talk code, or discuss ways to contribute or start community projects. If you can't make it out to the event, you can always give us a shout on the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack)!

Here's to the next year!
