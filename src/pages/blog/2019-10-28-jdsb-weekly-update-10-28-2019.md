We hope everyone had a wonderful, fun, safe Halloween weekend. If you haven't recovered from all the spooky excitement, fear not: we're taking this Monday open off, so you've got time!

In the meantime, we're working on some organizational stuff behind the scenes. The long hidden Organization page is now live, [right here](https://juniordevstrugglebus.com/organization), and houses our vision, mission, and values. Slowly but surely there is more coming down the pike, such as a community code of conduct and any other refinements we decide upon along the way. Let us know what you think and don't be shy about giving your input. Shout out in the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) with suggestions and opinions alike.

We've always course corrected in one direction or another based on what it felt like the community wanted, even when it isn't always publicly visible. You are our north star! We care what you want, what you'd like to see, and what JDSB represents for you.

We hope to be able to talk more about some cool stuff in the near future, but until then: we'll see you in November! :)
