You're all off the hook for tomorrow! The 23rd is an open but we will be back at the [Wayward on the 30th](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryzqbnc/).

In the meantime, we encourage you all to check out the JDSB [website](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/juniordevstrugglebus) and [blog](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/junior-dev-struggle-blog) GitHub repositories. Drop by the issues tabs to see if there is a problem you could solve and make that PR. Create a new issue you've noticed for someone else to tackle. Or maybe get in there and add something new just for the fun of it. Both sites are open source and fair game for proposed changes, so if you find yourself with some downtime over the holidays and have an idea, go for it!

On a related note, we are planning on the return of another Slack app/bot project early next year. So there will be one more JDSB project to toy with. Struggle Buddy will rise again!

We truly hope everyone is having a safe and happy holiday season. Whether you're bursting with merriment or perhaps feeling a bit lonely, jump into the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) sometime and give us a shout. Plenty of us are always around. :)
