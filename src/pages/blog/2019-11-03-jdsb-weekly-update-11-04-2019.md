Welcome to November and another [Wayward Monday](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/ntrxgryzpbgb/)!

We’re making a push for some datastore/database decisions for JDSB to help unify data across community projects. This will be a major topic of discussion at the meet tonight. JDSB relies pretty heavily on Netlify and the integrations it provides, making FaunaDB a top contender. The goal is to make a decision and have it on the table by the end of tonight's meet. If you’d like to contribute or provide your own opinions, be sure to come by and participate!

A few of our members are also jumping into [Game Off 2019](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019) together. The idea is to jam out a game following a loose theme (“Leaps and bounds” this year) with the project due by 13:37 Pacific on December 1st. The team is currently looking at the [Godot](https://godotengine.org) open source game engine. If you’re interested in getting in on that action, join the [\#captain-hopper-game](https://jdsb.slack.com/archives/CQ3RT1XKJ) channel on the [JDSB Slack](https://www.juniordevstrugglebus.com/slack) and put your name in the hat! Or maybe just get inspired to tackle a game on your own.

Another organizational goal we have is to help direct people to projects and problems that they can help with. Even making your first pull request on GitHub with a simple task is a great step forward if you’ve never done it before, so a small part of that effort is making tasks more visible. Check out the issues pages for the [JDSB website](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/juniordevstrugglebus/issues) and [JDSBlog](https://github.com/junior-dev-struggle-bus/junior-dev-struggle-blog/issues) — we will try to highlight issues with GitHub’s labeling system to indicate what might be an easy jumping off point, with the intension to be more comprehensive in the future.

Finally, if you can't make it out to the Wayward tonight, join us for a more a casual hang at [Optimism Brewing on November 11th](https://www.meetup.com/The-Junior-Dev-Struggle-Bus/events/265909693/)!
